# Design Patterns
A collection of "Gang of Four" and other design patterns implemented in C#. The goal of this project was to gain ultimate
knowledge of popular design patterns. The code was inspired by
examples found in the web. It was written with minimalistic approach in mind in order to keep it as small as possible,
 while still achieving the goal of clearly presenting the patterns. 
 
 Please note, that tests are not meant to be pure unit tests, but rather serve to show the patterns usage.
 
## Usage
The project can be compiled and run using Visual Studio 2015.
